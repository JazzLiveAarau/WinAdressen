ToDo.txt TODO for JazzAdressen
==============================

- Make a new version 11 

- Erase of the temporary files in directory Backups does not work.
  There is an exception. Do the following:
  a Add try - catch with error message 
  b Check and compare permissions for the subdirectory and let 
    the application or installer set the permissions.
  c Check in the appcation if subdirectories exist and have the right permissions
    Popup error messages telling what the user must do if permissions not are OK
	Write perhaps instructions in the manual

	The reason was hopefully that not the full file name was given as input to function GetBackupFiles
	With only the local file name it worked if the below shortcut paramater was set:
	Ausführen in: "C:\Apps\JAZZ live AARAU\Adressen"

- Installer should add NeueVersion

-In the manual emphasize that one has first to download the new version and then remove the application
 before the new version is installed.


- For Neu there is a problem to input support for two seasons

- Start with previous backup file if data is corrupt in starting CSV file
  (automatic to dialog)

- Scale dialog and text size. Perhaps remove "full screen" or let it be of 
  maximum size that the program sets

- Add return as jump to the the next field. 
  Checkt that tab works as jump to the next field

- Delete perhaps also the CSV file.

- Ask the users if the list shall be sorted after "Neue" Perhaps difficult to do....

- Add caps for all Dialog elements
- Path with 20%(?) for space. Problem with start of WinWord.
- Remove hardcoded Header Table data.

- Make Beta version for tests
  Let Philip make the Beta test first. Propose that Philip or I make
  the tests together with Bruno and/or Peter H.
- Search: It should not be possible to write in the search result area (now only color changed)
- Add output CheckData.txt: 
  No Newsletter, no Mail, no Support
- Mouse wheel: Never for Season, never for Output
